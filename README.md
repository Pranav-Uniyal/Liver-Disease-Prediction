# Liver Disease Prediction System

A machine learning system that attempts to predict liver disease using various classification algorithms. This project is currently experimental ‚Äî accuracy is modest, but it lays the groundwork for future improvements.

## üìå Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not production-ready**  
This project currently does **not meet clinical reliability standards**, but it is a good foundation for further research, experimentation, and community contributions.

---

##  Models Implemented

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

### üîπ SVM (Linear, `C=1.0`, `gamma=0.1`, `class_weight=balanced`)

| Metric        | Class 0 (No Disease) | Class 1 (Liver Disease) |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Precision     | 0.42                 | 0.89                     |
| Recall        | 0.87                 | 0.48                     |
| F1-score      | 0.57                 | 0.63                     |
| **Accuracy**  | **60%**              |                          |

- **Observation**: High false negatives for diseased patients. Model struggles to generalize on minority class.

### üîπ Logistic Regression (`class_weight=balanced`)

| Metric        | Class 0 (No Disease) | Class 1 (Liver Disease) |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Precision     | 0.42                 | 0.82                     |
| Recall        | 0.71                 | 0.57                     |
| F1-score      | 0.53                 | 0.68                     |
| **Accuracy**  | **61.6%**            |                          |

- **Observation**: Slightly better balance than SVM. Still weak for recall on Class 1.
